# Django Lab 6: Search Functionality with Forms

This lab focuses on implementing a search form in Django to filter and display book results based on user input. It includes creating a form, handling form submissions, and filtering results dynamically.

## Overview
1. **HTML Form**: A search form (`search.html`) allows users to enter a keyword and select options to search within book titles and authors.
2. **View Logic**: The `search_books` view processes form submissions to filter books based on user input.
3. **Dynamic Results**: After submission, the filtered book list is displayed on a results page (`bookList.html`).
